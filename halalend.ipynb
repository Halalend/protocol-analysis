    "# **Protocol Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This refers to the configurable variables and settings that govern the protocol’s behavior, including collateralization ratios, liquidation thresholds, loan terms, reserve ratios, etc. These parameters are essential for defining the protocol’s rules and risk management. The following parameters are essential for our model:\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Minimum Eligible Health Factor </span>* the minimum health factor allowed to avail loan.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Minimum Collateral Ratio (MCR) - ADA: </span>* This parameter specifies the minimum ratio of collateral (in ADA cryptocurrency) required relative to the loan amount to maintain the loan. If the collateral value falls below this ratio (unless there's a lower liquidation threshold) due to market fluctuations, the loan may become subject to liquidation to protect the lender from default risk.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Minimum Collateral Ratio (MCR) - Utility Token: </span>* Similar to the MCR for ADA, this parameter defines the minimum ratio of collateral required in a specific utility token relative to the loan amount. This ensures that loans backed by utility tokens maintain a sufficient collateral buffer to account for market volatility.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Minimum Loan Amount: </span>*: The minimum loan amount sets the lowest value of funds that can be borrowed through the protocol. This parameter ensures that loans are economically viable, taking into account the operational costs and the effort required to manage and monitor loans.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Maximum Loan Term: </span>*: This parameter defines the maximum duration for which a loan can be extended. It helps in managing the risk associated with long-term loans and ensures that loans are repaid within a reasonable timeframe, minimizing the exposure to prolonged market risks.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Protocol Usage Fee: </span>*: The Protocol Usage Fee is a fixed charge applied each time a loan is created or repaid within the protocol. This fee is designed to cover the costs associated with the loan's administration and the provision of the protocol's services.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Liquidation Penalty: </span>*: The liquidation penalty is a fee imposed on the collateral if the loan is liquidated due to a breach of the loan terms, such as falling below the minimum collateral ratio. This penalty acts as a deterrent against risky borrowing behavior and compensates the lender for the additional risk and effort involved in liquidating the collateral.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Reserve Threshold: </span>*: TBD\n",
    "---\n",
    "- *<span style=\"color: #CCCCCC;\">Reserve Ratio: </span>*: TBD\n",
