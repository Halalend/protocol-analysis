## ðŸ“„ Overview

### Native Token Sale

The Halalend protocol introduces a utility token for:
- **Collateral**: A requisite for loan acquisition.
- **Fee Distribution**: Rewarding stakers with a share of protocol-generated fees.
- **Governance**: Token holders can vote on protocol parameters.

### Creating a Loan Position

To secure a loan, users must:
1. Decide on the loan amount.
2. Provide collateral in ADA and Halalend tokens.
3. Choose the loan term.

A signed transaction locks the collateral and credits the loan in USD, minus protocol fees.

### Repaying a Loan

Loans are repaid at the borrowed amount, with collateral released upon repayment. This incurs a protocol usage fee.

### Liquidation

To maintain solvency, loans falling below the liquidation threshold or past due are automatically liquidated, with the collateral sold to cover the loan. Any surplus is returned to the borrower after deducting fees.

## ðŸ›  Protocol Parameters

Halalend's operational dynamics are defined by key parameters, including collateral ratios, liquidation thresholds, and loan terms, ensuring a balanced and secure lending environment.
