It's calculated by summing the value of all collateral assets (Asset A and Asset B) and dividing by the total loan amount, factoring in the respective exchange rates for each asset and the loan currency.\n",

    "- *Loan Term Expiry:* If the elapsed time since the loan was issued exceeds the agreed loan term, the loan is considered expired and eligible for liquidation.\n",
    "- *Collateral Value Drop*: If the current collateral ratio falls below the predefined liquidation threshold, it indicates that the collateral no longer provides adequate security for the loan due to a decrease in its market value.\n",
