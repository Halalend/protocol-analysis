    "# **Liquidating a loan position**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The liquidation process for loan positions in the Halalend protocol is fully automated and managed by a component known as the Batcher. This component has multiple responsibilities, including processing Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), managing repayments, and overseeing the addition of liquidity. A key function of the Batcher is to monitor loan positions vigilantly. It automatically identifies any loan positions that have fallen below the protocol's liquidation threshold or those that have exceeded the set loan term limit. Upon detecting such cases, the Batcher proceeds with the necessary steps to secure the loan positions, ensuring the stability and security of the protocol's financial operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qualification Criteria for liquidation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collateral Ratio:** This will be compared to the liquidation theshold. If it's below then the loan position is liquidated.\n",
    "- **Fees:** Loan positions are subject to liquidation fees. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Protocol Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liquidation Threshold:** Determines the required overcollateralization for loan approval.\n",
    "- **Liquidation Fee:** A fee charged for using the Halalend Protocol to create a loan position.\n",
    "- **Loan Term:** Specifies how long the loan will last before it needs to be repaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On-chain Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lending Validator:** A smart contract on Cardano that validates liquidation requests and ensures they comply with protocol rules.\n",
    "- **Protocol Parameters UTXO:** Stores the protocol's operational parameters and lending criteria for reference in transactions.\n",
    "- **Oracle/DEX Liquidity Pool UTXO:** Provides current exchange rates for collateral and loan assets, to accurately check if the loan position is below the liquidation threshold.\n",
    "- **Collateral Validator:** A smart contract on Cardano that validates if the collateral utxo can be unlocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-chain Infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batcher:** An essential background service that batches transactions for processing. This component is crucial due to Cardano's UTXO model, where a UTXO can only be consumed by one transaction in a block. The batcher ensures multiple transactions can be processed efficiently."
